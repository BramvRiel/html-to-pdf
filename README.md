# html-to-pdf
Open-source HTML to PDF generator.

# Compability
Html-to-pdf will aim to support this forward and backward compatibility as descirbed by Adobe:
> Overall the PDF file format is remarkably flexible: obviously it is forward compatible, allowing you to open an old PDF 1.0 file in the latest version of the Adobe Reader. Backward compatibility is also pretty good: a recent PDF 1.7 file can be opened by Acrobat 4. The older software will ignore the newer features and may not be able to display page elements that use them.


# NUnit
Unit tests will be done using NUnit.
